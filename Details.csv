redmi note 11,Flipkart Customer,3,Just okay,This phone is over all good... Camera is nice battery back up is almost ok but what Redmi have claimed about their 67 watt charger is totally wrong... Full charge in half an hour but it takes more than an hour to fully charge the phone and I am not satisfied with that...
